# PRODIGY_WD_02

Hello Everyone!

As a part of web development journey I have completed my task 02 at Prodigy Infotech Technologies

This task is mainly focusses on how to become familier with the tools like html, css and javascript and how to design an interactive web page using those technologies.

This task is mainly focusses on how to develop a simple stopwatch web application that includes a container, buttons and some code of javascript and css

Throughout the development of this web page I had gained some knowledge on html, css and javascript.

As a junior developer this task helped me to gain some knowloedge on the domain of web development.

Thank You !
